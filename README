Coffeescript classes to manipulate algebraic structures. Uses
"onion testing" to check that axioms are satisfied.

Some usage:

s = require './Structure.coffee'

Str  = new s.Monoid (new s.Set (x) -> typeof(x) == 'string'), ( (x,y) -> x+y ), ''
Z    = new s.Group (new s.Set (x) -> x == (Math.floor x)), ( (x,y) -> x+y ), 0, (x) -> -x
Zmod = (n) -> new s.Group (new s.Set (x) -> x in [0...n]), ( (x,y) -> (x+y)%n ), 0, (x) -> (n-x)%n
Z2   = Zmod 2
Z3   = Zmod 3
